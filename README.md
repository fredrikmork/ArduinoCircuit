1. Initially, the system is in the LOCKEDðŸ”’ The red LED is on when the system is in a LOCKED state.  
2. When motion is detected, the yellow LED must be switched on; and the system is in a state WAITING for:  
      The user to do two pushes on the buttons. After each push, the yellow LED should blink shortly.  
3. If the order it correct, then system will become UNLOCKEDðŸ”“, and the green LED is switched on.  
4. If the order it not correct, the red LED should blink and the system will go back to a LOCKED state.
5. After a certain amount of time in the UNLOCKED state, the system should automatically enter the LOCKED state.
6. (Not yet implemented)If a user is idle for x seconds, the system will go back to LOCKED state.
